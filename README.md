# Timer CLI

This is a CLI tool that can be used to:

- set a timer or start a stopwatch.
- You can pause/resume the timer/stopwatch by pressing `p`.
- You can exit timer/stopwatch by pressing `q`.
- You can record a lap in stopwatch by pressing `l`.
- There is a `Help` option to see available commands and keybindings.
- A notification will be triggered after a timer is completed.
- The current state of the timer/stopwatch is saved and can be loaded later.
