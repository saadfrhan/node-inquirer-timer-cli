Start a Timer: Begin by learning how to start a simple timer. Use a straightforward command to start a countdown timer for a short duration, like 1 or 2 minutes.

Display Timer Status: Familiarize yourself with how the CLI displays the timer status. Understand how the remaining time or elapsed time is shown during the timer's operation.

Stop the Timer: Practice stopping the timer manually before it completes its duration. This will give you a sense of control over the timer.

Pause and Resume: If the CLI supports pausing and resuming timers, learn how to pause a running timer and then resume it.

Customize Timer Settings: Explore any available options for customizing the timer's appearance, such as changing the text color or output format. This step is optional but can make your timer experience more enjoyable.

Countdown or Stopwatch Mode: If the CLI supports both countdown and stopwatch modes, try using both to see how they differ. Countdown mode is useful for tasks with a fixed duration, while stopwatch mode is handy for tracking elapsed time.

Set Timer Duration: Learn how to set different timer durations, both for countdown and stopwatch modes. Practice setting timers for various time intervals.

Alerts and Notifications: If the CLI provides alerts or notifications when the timer completes, ensure you understand how they work and how to disable them if needed.

Reset or Restart the Timer: If available, experiment with resetting or restarting a timer after it stops. This feature can save you time when reusing the same timer.

Time Tracking and Logging: If the CLI offers time tracking and logging features, explore how to use them to keep records of your timer usage.

Multiple Timers: If the CLI supports multiple timers, try running two or more timers simultaneously and observe how they interact.

Integration with Other Tools: Lastly, if applicable, explore how the timer CLI can integrate with other CLI applications or scripts to automate tasks based on timer completion or specific events.
